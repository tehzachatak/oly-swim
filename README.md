# oly-swim
This is a project to do analysis of Olympic swimming results.
* Stage 1 is to acquire and clean data across all events
* Stage 2 is to do an overlap analysis (looking at what swimmers have participated in multiple events)
* Stage 3 is to develop a predictive model of results based only on past Olympic event results
